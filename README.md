# **ACADEMIC - NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING LABS**

**Done by:** MOHAMED AMINE FAKHRE-EDDINE

**Supervised by:** Pr. Lotfi EL AACHAK

This repository contains the labs I've done during my academic year in the Natural Language Processing course.

## **Lab 1**
The first lab focused on the basics of NLP, including web scraping, data storing, cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging and NER.

You can find the report [here](/lab-1/README.md) or in pdf format [here](/docs/Report-Lab-1.pdf). 

## **Lab 2**
**Objective:** The main purpose behind this lab is to get familiar with NLP Rule based, Regex and NLP Word embedding.

**Work to do:**

**Part 1:** Rule Based NLP and Regex:
Using Regex, write a Python code that can generate a bill from a text given by the user.

**Use case:**
"I bought three Samsung smartphones 150 $ each, four kilos of fresh banana for 1,2 dollar a kilogram and one Hamburger with 4,5 dollar".

Generated Bill:
Product Quantity Unit Price Total Price
Samsung smartphone 3 150 450
Banana 4 1.2 3.2
Hamburger 1 4.5 4.5

Part 2: Word Embedding:
1. Apply one-hot encoding, bag of words, and TF-IDF techniques on the Data vectors collected during the lab 1.
2. Apply one Word2Vec Approach (Skip Gram, CBOW) on the same DataSet.
3. Apply Glove and FastText approaches on the same DataSet.
4. Plot all the encoded/vectorized vectors using the Tsne Algorithm, evaluate those approaches, and give a general conclusion.
