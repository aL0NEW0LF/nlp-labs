This repository contains the labs I've done during my academic year in the Natural Language Processing course.

## **Lab 1**
The first lab focused on the basics of NLP, including web scraping, data storing, cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging and NER.

You can find the report [here](/lab-1/README.md) or in pdf format [here](/docs/Report-Lab-1.pdf).
